# payday_calc
Calculator for projecting your finances until your next pay. Enter your monthly bills and your current checking account balance and receive your projected remaining balance after bills. Additionally, you can identify which expenses are "mandatory" (e.g. amounts you are required to pay vs. any extra you may allocate to pay off a debt faster.)
