PayDay Apportionment Calculator App

Notes:
- Adding a new table containing user info, if we leave the user_name and current balance fields blank,
then they are filled with default values in subsequent rows of the user table.
- "Add Expense" button also adds a row to the User table
- Add user_name field to Expense table in payday.db.
	+ Default to previous username...

Notes on Running the App/Initializing DB:
 - Running app: python -m flask --app app run --debug
 - Initializing db, use the following in a Python shell from inside project folder.
	>>> from app import app, db
	>>> app.app_context().push()
	>>> db.create_all()

Enter your current bank balance (or grab it somehow).
Enter (pre-load) monthly bills and desired apportionments.
Indicate which apportionments are mandatory and which are not.

Computation:
	- Include "real" month data, different number of pay periods.
	- When are certain bills due (though...)

Output:
	- How much money will be allotted.
	- How much money CAN be used for other purposes (e.g. fun, sudden expenses)
	- How much will be leftover

Questions to address:
	+ How to save monthly bills so they can just be uploaded for computation with a new current_balance?
	+ Using a separate current_balance field.
	+ Can I have two different "submit" buttons doing two different things.
